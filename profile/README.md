We're glad to have you here! ðŸŽ‰ The `openim` GitHub organization represents the next chapter in our journey of providing robust, open-source instant messaging solutions for developers and communities worldwide.

## :rocket: Our Journey

Previously known as [openimsdk](https://github.com/openimsdk), we've grown and evolved. As part of this evolution, we've decided to move the core components from `openimsdk` to our new repository at `openim`. This move signifies our commitment to improving, scaling, and building a more resilient platform for all our users.
